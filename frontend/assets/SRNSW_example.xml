        <Paragraph>The <Source>Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1986</Source> provides for a Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Committee (the 'Industry Committee'), which acts as an advisory and appellate body. The Industry Committee consists of ten part-time members appointed by the Minister.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>The Industry Committee is empowered under s.9 of the Act to advise the Corporation on administration of the Act, including matters concerning publicity, the investment of funds and the rate of the long service levy. The Industry Committee decides worker's appeals lodged against decisions of the Corporation, and decides appeals lodged by levy payers. It also acts as a 'Customer Council' in relation to customer service standards and helps to ensure that the quality and effectiveness of services meet customers' needs.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>The Corporation is able to provide the building and construction industry with regular updates on its services/achievements and consult with industry representatives on any issues affecting its operations via the Industry Committee.</Paragraph>

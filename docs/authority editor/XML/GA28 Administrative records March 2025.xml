        <Emphasis>Introduction</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Implementing retention and disposal authorities ensures that records are retained for the correct period of time and no longer (or shorter) than necessary. It also ensures that records are disposed of in a timely, routine and efficient manner. Undertaking sentencing and regular disposal of records ensures that the organisation is not exposed to unnecessary costs for retaining paper and digital records it no longer requires.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comprehensive information about implementing disposal authorities is found in State Records' guideline <Source>Implementing a disposal authority.</Source></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Minimum retention periods</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The authority specifies minimum retention periods for all records not required as State archives. A public office must not destroy or otherwise dispose of records before the minimum retention period has expired. If a public office desires to reduce the minimum retention period it must seek specific written approval from State Records. Public offices may retain records for longer periods of time, subject to organisational need, without further reference to State Records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Retention of electronic records</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Electronic records must be protected and readily accessible for the specified minimum retention period. See <Source>Managing digital records</Source> for information relating to managing the accessibility of technology dependent records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Imaged records</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Many public offices routinely image records. This may be the scanning of incoming correspondence or bulk digitisation of forms or vouchers or files. Most hard copy originals are authorised for destruction after imaging, provided a number of conditions are met. Public offices should check <Source>General retention and disposal authority: original or source records that have been copied</Source> for more information.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Destroying records</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>When the approved minimum retention period has been reached, appropriate arrangements for the destruction of records may be undertaken without further reference to State Records, unless otherwise advised.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Persons using the authority should apply it with caution, bearing in mind that the approvals for disposal are given in terms of the State Records Act only. It is the responsibility of every public office to ensure that all legal and other requirements for retention of records have been met before disposing of any of its records. A public office must not destroy records if they are:<List><Item>subject to current or pending legal proceedings</Item><Item>subject to an application for access under the <Source>Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009</Source>, the <Source>Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2003</Source> or the <Source>Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998</Source></Item><Item>subject to a Government policy or directive not to be destroyed.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Circulating lists of records proposed to be destroyed to relevant action officers as part of routine procedures prior to any destruction being carried out may assist to ensure these issues are identified.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>See <Source>Destruction of records: a practical guide</Source> for information on destruction methods and considerations.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Managing records required as State archives</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records which are to be retained as State archives are identified with the disposal action 'Required as State archives'. Records identified in retention and disposal authorities as State archives and no longer in use for official purposes in the public office should be transferred to State Records' control. The transfer of control of records as State archives may, or may not, involve a change in custodial arrangements. Records can continue to be managed by the public office under a distributed management agreement. Public offices are encouraged to make arrangements with State Records regarding the management of State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Transferring records identified as State archives and no longer in use for official purposes to State Records' control should be a routine and systematic part of a public office's records management program. If the records are more than 25 years old and are still in use for official purposes, then a 'still in use determination' should be made.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To obtain assistance regarding transferring material as State archives, contact the Senior Archivist, Transfer/Custody at: transfer@records.nsw.gov.au or (02) 9673 1788. For more information concerning entering into a distributed management agreement, contact the Senior Project Officer, Distributed Management at: distributed@records.nsw.gov.au or (02) 9673 1788.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Transfer of ownership must be approved</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Regardless of whether a record has been approved for destruction or is required as a State archive, a public office must not transfer ownership of a State record to any person or organisation without the explicit authorisation of State Records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Interpretation of disposal triggers in this authority</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>It is very important that triggers are appropriately interpreted and understood by those implementing the authority. Sometimes they rely on information from elsewhere in the organisation, e.g. date of birth of an employee. Where possible, the organisation should build the recording of the dates or required information into standard records procedures so staff will know, for example, when a file should be marked as inactive or closed. Without this information being recorded, sentencing cannot take place in a streamlined or efficient manner.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>After action completed:</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This is the most common disposal trigger in the authority. 'Action completed' refers to the final transaction of business, i.e. the final document is attached to the file and the file is closed. An action does not include a file movement or audit (unless the organisation determines an audit is an action).</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>In the case of paper-based registers the date of the last entry in the register may be a suitable trigger for when action is completed (providing all actions associated with the matters recorded in the register have been completed). In the case of electronic registers, however, it may be more appropriate to apply the disposal action to individual entries in the register rather than the register as a whole (as the last action on the register as a whole may be indefinite). In this case the trigger can be calculated from the last time an individual entry in the register was updated or amended, or from when the data has become obsolete (i.e. when all the business for which the record was maintained has been completed).</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Until ceases to be of administrative or reference use:</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This trigger usually applies where ongoing use of the records is likely to be short term, or where ongoing reference use of the records is linked to the conduct of business processes and the determination of appropriate periods for retention relies on an organisation's assessment of its own business needs and uses. This can vary from one organisation to another depending on the nature of its business.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>For the purposes of implementing the authority and facilitating the production of reports or triggers for the review of these records as part of a regular disposal program the organisation may wish to define a standard retention period for these types of records. Suitable standard retention periods can be defined through discussions with business units or action officers who use the records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>After expiry or termination:</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This trigger is commonly used for contracts, agreements, licences etc. The organisation needs to determine how long this will be, based on the individual circumstances. In the case where there are set periods of operation built into contracts, agreements etc this will be straightforward to convert to an 'after action completed' trigger. However, any extension of the contract, agreement etc would require a change in the retention period.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>After superseded:</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This trigger usually relates to policies, procedures etc. The organisation needs to have a mechanism to note when policies, procedures etc are replaced so that the trigger can be applied.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Upon expiry of statutory limitation periods:</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This trigger is used when the statutory limitation period for commencing a legal action or claim will vary from an adult to a child (e.g. when it is dependent on the person's age). The organisation is responsible for seeking advice regarding the expiry of the statutory limitation period before implementing the disposal action.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Managing the calculation of triggers and disposal processes</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Public offices need to consider and plan how they are to manage the implementation of triggers. For some it may be possible to automate the process. For example, a date of birth may be entered into the public office's human resource management system and automatically applied as a 'after date of birth' trigger in the records management system.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>If automation is not possible, the development of business rules or procedures may be required to ensure that information is communicated by the relevant business unit to the records management unit so that the trigger is applied.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>When disposal dates have been reached, procedures should also be in place to ensure the circulation of lists or details of records proposed for destruction to relevant action officers for internal authorisation and approval before any disposal action takes place. These officers can identify if circumstances have changed, e.g. extensions of contracts or legal cases, which will affect the implementation of disposal decisions and may warrant the retention of records for longer periods as appropriate.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Implementing alternative disposal actions</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Some disposal classes provide two or more alternative disposal decisions, depending on the nature of the records (e.g. most classes for records relating to agreements provide a minimum retention period of 12 years for specialty contracts and a minimum retention period of 7 years for standard contracts or agreements). These disposal decisions require the user to apply the correct decision.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To enable the automation of sentencing in electronic systems, all such disposal decisions are labelled with (A), (B) or (C). This letter can be added to the disposal class number in electronic systems, thereby providing a unique identifier for each disposal action.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Major/minor classes in the authority</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>On some occasions, classes are divided into 'major', 'significant' or 'substantive' versus 'minor' or 'routine' records or events. When these classes occur, there are usually examples provided of types of records or events that may fall into each category in order to guide organisations. For example, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS - DISPUTES 11.4.1:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>'Records relating to the management of industrial disputes of a significant nature where the organisation is a primary party to the negotiations or resolution of the dispute. Significant disputes can include those:<List><Item>resulting in a strike, ban or lock-out</Item><Item>that set precedents, or</Item><Item>that result in innovative or contentious changes to working conditions.'</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>As a guide, the types of events or matters that may be considered to fall within the category of 'significant' or 'major' include those that:<List><Item>affect the whole-of-government or portfolio function</Item><Item>concern major liabilities or obligations of the organisation or the State</Item><Item>relate to the development of legislation, regulations or policies</Item><Item>relate to controversial matters (i.e. subject to formal or parliamentary inquiry or intense media scrutiny)</Item><Item>have wide community interest</Item><Item>otherwise significantly affect the organisation's functions or structure.</Item></List></Paragraph>

        <Justification>
          <Paragraph>The records have no ongoing value once the information has been cumulated into the financial statements and summaries described in class 3.6.1. The nominated minimum retention period is based on potential use of the records for administrative and reference purposes while statements and summaries are current.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Formerly periodic financial statements and summaries prepared for management on a regular basis were required to be retained at least until cumulated into quarterly or annual statements or until superseded by a later statement (GDA7, 2.12.2). Public offices commented during the review of GDA7 that it is difficult to automatically sentence records in electronic systems if the disposal action does not quantify a minimum retention period. The nominated period is analogous to the former disposal action.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>Formerly records relating to issues, claims or case matters which were not precedent setting in nature or did not result in significant changes to the organisation's policies were required to be retained for 15 years, or until expiry of limitation period, whichever was longer (GA28, 13.4.2). This imposed significant burdens on those public offices that are regularly involved in legal proceedings in terms of storing vast quantities of records for this period.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>The nominated minimum retention period is consistent with the Law Society of NSW's Professional conduct and practice rules, which state that legal practitioners must retain documents relating to a matter for the duration of the practitioner's retainer and at least 7 years thereafter (s.8.2.1), and with those identified for similar records created and maintained by Australian and Queensland Government agencies (National Archives of Australia, Administrative functions disposal authority, class 1586; Queensland State Archives, General retention and disposal schedule for administrative records, class 5.3.8), and was confirmed as appropriate in consultation with public offices.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Note:</Emphasis> Current minimum retention periods for records relating to monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, and energy production and consumption may not reflect the retention requirements specified in new or updated legislation. Before implementing the disposal decisions in this authority, organisations should ensure they are aware of any legislative requirements to retain records for longer than specified by the minimum retention periods. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Note:</Emphasis> State and local government agencies responsible for the management of Crown reserves, commons and land that is currently or may potentially be the subject of a claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 should ensure records providing evidence of ownership, control and usage of the relevant parcel are retained and not destroyed until a claim has been granted over that parcel of land. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>These records could include planning documents or decisions concerning proposed or approved use of the land, surveys, agreements, memorandums, consents and tenure arrangements regarding the following land matters – acquisition, transfers, boundaries, usage, rights of way and easements, leases or licences for any uses/purposes, land/resource management and management of parks and reserves. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Please note that the making of a claim which is unsuccessful does not preclude the making of further claims over the same areas of land under the Act. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>For further advice and guidance as to land that is claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and records requiring retention, agencies should contact the Crown Lands division of the Land and Property Management Authority.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>Under section 31(3) of the Real Property Act 1900, on and from cessation day:</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>“(a) the Registrar-General is no longer required to issue certificates of title under this Act or any other Act</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>Other: This entry will supersede the General Disposal Authority: General video/surveillance records created by public offices (GDA8).</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Disposal action changed from retain in accordance with agency requirements, to until administrative or reference use ceases for consistency with Victoria and Tasmania.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>The Australian Standard 4806-2006 (R2015): Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) – Management and Operation sets a minimum retention period of 31 days after capture for CCTV recordings stored digitally, and for analogue tapes as long as is practicable before erasure.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Consultation with public offices was undertaken in 2017 and although some public offices were able to comply with the 31 day period set out in the Standard, other public offices stored their CCTV footage with external providers who had a set 28 day retention period, or the footage was of low risk activities that did not require retention as per the Standard (for example, footage of animals at Taronga Zoo for animal welfare purposes).</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Imposing the 31 day period from the Standard would have placed a number of public offices in breach of the State Records Act as they are unable to amend the minimum retention periods with external providers, or caused them to pay for storage for recordings longer than was necessary for their business purposes.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>This entry does not cover public offices who already have specific coverage for their CCTV footage. For example, NSW Police retain recordings of routine surveillance of custodial areas in Police premises where the records are not used for evidentiary purposes for 6 months. Transport retain camera surveillance footage for 20 days. </Paragraph>

          <Item>Where an organisation has very high risk functions, full or partial ‘snapshots’ of their websites may be necessary for accountability purposes.

The disposal of any snapshots should be covered in the organisation’s functional retention and disposal authority.</Item>

Previously records were identified as State archives on the basis that they allow for an understanding of how the logical and actual structure of the site has been implemented and developed over time and the relationship between publications on the site, some of which will be required as State archives. However re-appraisal identified that, site maps, whilst documenting how information was organised on a web site are not essential to support long term understanding and interpretation of publications made available via web sites that may be retained as State archives. As web sites are now ubiquitous across government and their content more dynamic the retention of site maps as State archives has limited utility with respect to documenting key business decisions and actions of government and their impact.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>The nominated disposal action is based on potential use of the records for administrative and reference purposes, which will vary from organisation to organisation, and is consistent with that identified for similar records created and maintained by Victorian Government agencies (Public Record Office Victoria, General retention and disposal authority for records of common administrative functions, class 15.7.2).</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Formerly records that demonstrated the structure and organisation of intranets and records of substantial changes made were required as State archives (GA28 (2007), 17.15.2, superseded 2014). Re-appraisal identified that site maps, whilst documenting how information was organised on a web site, are not essential to support long term understanding and interpretation of publications made available via web sites that may be retained as State archives. As web sites are now ubiquitous across government and their content more dynamic the retention of site maps as State archives has limited utility with respect to documenting key business decisions and actions of government and their impact.</Paragraph>

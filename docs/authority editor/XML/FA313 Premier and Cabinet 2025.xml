      <Paragraph>The Department of Premier and Cabinet was created on 27 April 2007 by the combination of the former Premier's Department with the Cabinet Office. The Premier’s Department was initially established as a separate department of Government around 1909. Prior to this it existed as the Premier’s Office within the Department of Attorney-General and of Justice. The Cabinet Office has existed since around 1921, and has had various titles, including the Cabinet Section, the Cabinet and Parliamentary Division, and Cabinet Secretariat. It has always been associated with the Premier’s portfolio.</Paragraph>

      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This authority provides coverage for the core functional responsibilities and activities of the Department, namely those relating to:<List><Item>the provision of strategic advice and policy support services to the Premier and Government</Item><Item>the management of statewide issues, initiatives and projects</Item><Item>regulatory reform, performance reviews and service delivery improvement</Item><Item>management of public sector employee relations and workforce reforms</Item><Item>the provision of ministerial and parliamentary services to support the machinery of government </Item><Item>Government ceremonies and hospitality.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Department maintains records relating to these functions dating back to 1976 and potentially earlier. The authority will apply to permit the destruction of records dating from 1976 onwards. This date corresponds with the first Wran Ministry and in general with the date range of disposal recommendations previously authorised for use on an ongoing basis by the Department. Approved disposal actions for records identified as State archives may be applied irrespective of the date of the records. Authorisation for the destruction of records predating 1976 will be developed if required once any earlier records have been more comprehensively identified and appraised.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This authority is to be used in conjunction with <Source>Functional retention and disposal authority: cabinet secretariat, policy advice and support services </Source>(FA254, approved February 2008)) and with other current authorities covering records of specific ministerial portfolio responsibilities, such as local government, environment and heritage, assigned to the Premier. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This authority also includes coverage for the Aboriginal Trust Fund Repayment Scheme (ATFRS). The scheme was established in 2005 to repay to Aboriginal people and their descendants money that was collected from and put into trust accounts for them by the Aborigines Protection Board and later the Aborigines Welfare Board and was never repaid. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Previous disposal authorisations</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>A number of disposal recommendations were previously issued to the Department. This functional retention and disposal authority will supersede these previous disposal recommendations, except where it may be appropriate to permit the discretionary transfer of records not covered by this authority as State archives under these earlier recommendations.</Paragraph>

        <Emphasis>Background</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The following provides a summary of comments received from Emeritus Professor Mark Aronson, Professor Lyn Carson, Professor Peter Read and Dr Peter Tyler on the draft retention and disposal authority for the records of the Department of Premier and Cabinet.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>General comments</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Professor Carson limited her feedback to the function of Community Cabinets, and endorsed the retention of these records as State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Dr Read made a general comment on the classes relating to the Aboriginal Trust Fund Repayment Scheme records: 'I came to the task in some trepidation, but on the Aboriginal part, which is my area of expertise, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the papers marked for disposal seemed a perfectly reasonable choice. So I have no problem with the recommendations for this section'.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Dr Tyler commented 'as a practising professional historian, I naturally have an inclination towards preserving all official records, especially those of an agency which is so central to the functioning of the State of New South Wales. At the same time, I recognise that this is not a realistic or practical objective. Under the circumstances, I believe that you have made a cautious and prudent assessment of the potential future administrative or historical value of the documents described in the draft'. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Professor Aronson commented 'I am struck by how much thought and care have gone into its preparation'.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Dr Tyler and Professor Aronson also provided comments and recommendations in relation to a number of specific entries. Details of their comments and any amendment of the authority in response are outlined below: </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Note</Emphasis>: The comments of external stakeholders relate to a previous version of the draft authority. All amendments outlined in State Records' response have been incorporated into this version of the authority.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Entry 1.1.3 </Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>ABORIGINAL TRUST FUND REPAYMENT SCHEME (AFTRS) – Claims</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records relating to meetings and liaison held with other agencies and stakeholders to coordinate and discuss the administration of claims processes. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Dr Tyler</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This is a somewhat contentious area, which is likely to be of ongoing historic interest.  I consider that 10 years before disposal is too brief, and would suggest a minimum of 30 years, perhaps even 50 years.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I would strongly counsel against destruction after 10 years. It is entirely possible that information relevant to classes 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 will be overlooked, buried as it will sometimes be within documents regarding meetings and liaison. It is much safer to retain these documents, rather than rely on the accuracy of the sorting process.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Re Dr Tyler's comments:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Retention for 30 or 50 years is considered overly long, especially given the records relate to coordination of the administration of the scheme, not to its establishment or the determination of eligibility of claimants. However the records may be a useful reference if other schemes need to be established in the future, therefore an increase in the retention period from 10 to 20 years after action completed is supported. This equates to the proposed retention period for records covered by entry 8.2.5, which also deal with the administration of processes and procedures. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Re Professor Aronson's comments:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The records covered by 1.1.1 (records relating to receipt and determination of claims) would be maintained separately to records covered by 1.1.3. It is unlikely that records coming under 1.1.3, which relate to coordination between agencies of the administration of the scheme and the claims handling process, would contain information relevant to the determination of a particular individual's claim. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>There is the possibility that records covered by 1.1.3 may be overlap with records covered by 1.1.2 with respect to consultation on the development of guidelines, in which case the application of 1.1.2 to the records should prevail.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Details of amendment</Emphasis>: Retention period increased from proposed minimum of 10 to 20 years after action completed.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Entry 3.1.4</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>COMMUNITY SUPPORT – Committees</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records relating to the development of guidelines, handbooks and information resources, brochures, etc. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Dr Tyler </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I favour these being retained for a minimum of 10 years after action completed. This would cover the period of two State elections (and possible changes of Government), and would help to ensure that corporate memory is preserved through a period in which there might be substantial organisational changes.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>There should be a carve-out from 3.1.4 for anything to do with indigenous affairs. These records will be necessary to assess the provenance of policy and guidelines. Historians will otherwise be left with an archive of government policy, but with the occasional question mark about the extent to which it might have been developed in response to external representations.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Re Dr Tyler's comments:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Recommendation adopted.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Re Professor Aronson's comments:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records relating to the development of the policy (e.g. to increase and foster opportunities for the community (or particular community groups) to participate in decision making through representation on boards and committees) are identified for retention as State archives under entry 3.4.1 (Policy). These records would capture records of consultations or representations influencing policy development.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The guidelines and handbooks developed by DPC primarily deal with procedural processes to be observed by agencies to give effect to established government policy. The records intended to be covered by this entry would primarily relate to the compilation and drafting of these documents, not the formulation of government policy. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Details of amendments</Emphasis>:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Entry 3.1.4 amended to increase nominated minimum retention period for records relating to the compilation and drafting of guidelines and handbooks for managing appointments, remuneration and standards of conduct for board and committee members from proposed 5 to 10 years.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Additional entry, 3.1.5, included to separately cover brochures and web site information produced for the public.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Entries 3.3.3 and 3.3.4</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>COMMUNITY SUPPORT - Grant assistance</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records relating to the assessment and administration of grants that are not of State, local or regional significance, do not have broad impact or are not approved by the Premier and grant applications that are unsuccessful. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I would be interested to know whether political scientists would prefer that documents in 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 be retained as State archives. Minor grants have always been a potent political tool, even though considered individually, they lack any broader impact.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To adopt recommendations re 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 would entail retention of all records relating to the receipt, assessment and administration of grant applications as State archives. However retention of records that would provide an insight into grants of a minor nature or of applications which were  not successful has been incorporated into the authority. Details of any grants or funding disbursed by the Department are also recorded in the Department's annual report.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph><Emphasis>Details of amendments</Emphasis>: </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Wording of entry 3.3.1 amended to explicitly include reference to unsuccessful grant applications. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Additional entry included to identify records of committees or panels involved in the assessment of grant or funding applications as State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Entries 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 </Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT – Community Liaison</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>These entries covered records of liaison and meetings with community leaders and representatives of community groups to discuss matters or issues relating to the management or minimisation of security risks. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records of liaison and meetings with community leaders and representatives of 'high risk' groups were identified as State archives (4.2.1). Records of meeting and liaison with other groups to discuss security or emergency management were approved for destruction (4.2.2).</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I am unsure of the exact difference between 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. On my reading of the draft, 'high risk' groups have no carve-outs from State archives, whilst others do. However, a group’s risk level is not necessarily stable over long periods of time. It would therefore be preferable for 4.2.2 to be State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To minimise application of subjective criteria and clarify distinction between nature and types of processes and interaction covered the entries have been amended as follows:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>4.2.1 Records of liaison and meetings with leaders and representatives of community groups to discuss matters or issues relating to the management or minimisation of security risks.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Required as State archives</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>4.2.2 Records relating to general liaison and information exchange with community groups concerning security or emergency management arrangements or initiatives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Retain minimum of 5 years after action completed, then destroy</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Records relating to the response to emergency incidents that have a limited impact on persons or property (i.e. do not involve significant loss of life or major injury or damage to property within the State or a particular region or locality or do not have major policy/legislative impact).

      <Paragraph>Comment from Dr Tyler</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Despite their 'limited impact' in the immediate sense, such events can have an enduring interest and historic value (e.g. the Springbok Rugby tour of 1971). I would favour these documents being retained as State Records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>As it stands, 4.3.2 allows for the eventual destruction of records of proactive crisis management where a major crisis was averted. That is in contrast to 4.3.1 which rightly seeks to archive the records relating to major incidents that have occurred. We surely have something to learn, however, from crisis management that successfully averted crises. I am not wholly against 4.3.2. Rather, I suggest that it be amended, so that documents are retained as State archives where they relate to crisis management for major events, even though they turned out to be incident-free.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Re Dr Tyler's comments:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>DPC is generally not the primary coordinating, planning or management agency with respect to this function and has limited involvement with respect to incidents of minor impact. Records of the Police or Emergency Services agencies would be the primary source records for this type of research.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>If the recommendation at 4.3.3 is designed in part to preserve evidence negating negligence allegations, then it will need to be kept longer than 7 years. The standard limitation deadlines for negligence actions can be considerably longer for those who were children at the time of the event. </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Comment from Professor Aronson</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I am unsure of the reasoning behind the recommendation at 10.1.2. It seems to be that the important documents will come from the Assembly. However, the Premier needs the confidence of the Legislative Assembly, and it is therefore conceivable that important documents relating to the administration of casual vacancies could at some time have originated (or will originate) in the DPC.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Legislative Assembly vacancies are filled though by-elections which are administered/arranged through the Legislative Assembly. The DPC does not usually prepare any documents in relation to this process but receives advice from the Legislative Assembly of the proposed election timetable and return of the writs. Records relating to the issue of election writs are identified as State archives under entry 10.1.1.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Based on further advice from and consultation with DPC this entry has been amended to clarify its scope applies to records relating to the provision of advice to the Premier concerning the administration of casual vacancies with the Parliament and these records are identified as State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>An additional entry, 10.1.3, has been included to cover records relating to the receipt of advice from the Legislative Assembly on timetables and the return of writs for the administration of casual vacancies. These records have a proposed minimum retention period of 5 years after action completed.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>I understand the recommendation at 10.5.2, but suggest that the minimum retention period might be too short. Further action from the Premier’s Office might be needed beyond the 2 year period, even though it is appeared at first that the matter was closed. I therefore suggest a slightly longer retention period.</Paragraph>

    <ContextContent>
      <Paragraph>This authority is a revision of the current retention and disposal requirements applying to records of grant programs delivered by the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC) under functional retention and disposal authority FA313 (approved October 2011). </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>DPC, in the past and currently, provides grants to local councils, non-government organisations, community groups and (in limited circumstances) individuals to undertake various community projects, activities or services. The grant programs generally involve the provision of small amounts of money only for community based local projects or activities. In most instances the NSW Government's contribution will only be a proportion of the total cost of the project or activity which they fund. These programs may be directly administered by DPC or by other agencies on behalf of DPC, for example the Community Building Partnership program, a DPC funded program implemented via a joint arrangement between DPC and the Office of Communities. The disbursement of funds to successful grant applicants under these programs, while administered by another agency, is still approved by the Premier as the responsible minister and subject to DPC oversight and monitoring. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Currently under FA313, records relating to the administration of approved grants, where these are of local significance or are approved by the Premier, are identified for retention as State archives. It has since been identified that, because of the nature of the grants and funding programs generally administered by DPC (or by other agencies on behalf of DPC), use of the Premier's approval or a project being of local significance as a criteria for identification of State archives will result in the retention of the majority of all records relating to the administration of successful grants as State archives. This is not considered warranted given the types of projects or activities receiving funding and the availability of summary information about grant applicants, successful recipients, types of projects funded and the amounts provided in other records being retained as State archives.  </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Emphasis>Changes to reduce over retention</Emphasis>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This authority modifies the criteria for records requiring retention as State archives and reduces the current minimum retention requirements applying to records of unsuccessful grant applications.  </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The amendments include:<List><Item>modification of the entry covering records of assessment committees or panels decisions with respect to the disbursement of grants and funding to include 'submissions to the Premier or responsible delegated officer concerning recommendations for grant or funding approvals and records documenting the Premier's or delegated officer's approval or variance of these recommendations' (1.1).</Item><Item>modification of the current criteria for identification of records relating to the administration of successful applications warranting retention as State archives under FA313, entry 3.3.2 from 'grants [that] are of State, local or regional significance, have broad impact or are approved by the Premier' to '[grants that relate] to projects or services of State or regional significance' (1.4). Records documenting the provision of grants for services, projects or programs of State or regional significance are still identified as State archives. This would generally apply to major programs through which the Government provides funding to non government organisations and local government councils to deliver essential frontline services to the community.</Item><Item>a reduction in the current minimum retention requirements applying to records of unsuccessful grant applications from 7 years to 2 years. The amended retention period is sufficient to support accountability with respect to assessment processes. Details of grants or funding disbursed by an agency are documented in their Annual report. Summary records documenting the receipt and assessment of applications and recommendations and approvals concerning the allocation of funds are identified as State archives (1.6).</Item><Item>inclusion of an additional class permitting the destruction of summary records or registers of grant applications (successful or unsuccessful) where the information or details will also be documented in the organisation’s annual report or related assessment committee records or ministerial submissions. This will enable the destruction of records where the information is otherwise duplicated or available from other records being retained as State archives (1.3).</Item></List></Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>The Cabinet Office and the Premier’s Department use FA254 (issued 2008) and FA313 (revised in 2018) for their records.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Premier’s Department recently reviewed the disposal authorities and approached State Records NSW to request minor updates (e.g. change of wording from Cabinet minutes to Cabinet meeting submissions in entry 2). As part of the review State Records NSW suggested:<List><Item>changes to the retention periods grants records</Item><Item>moving entries from FA254 into FA313 so they would have a single disposal authority.</Item></List></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This was agreed to.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The following changes are proposed:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Records	Change	Justification	Entry</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Cabinet Office’s set of agenda and Executive Council minutes.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Retain until administrative or reference use ceases then destroy	Removal of requirement that The Cabinet Office can only destroy their set of  Executive Council Minutes once it is confirmed that the Office of the Governor has  transferred their set as State archives.	The Office of the Governor manages the hard copy signed set of Executive Council Minutes and has already transferred up to 2007 to the State Archives Collection. The more recent sets are held securely at Government House. It is not considered necessary for Cabinet to retain copies until they are transferred.	1</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Cabinet and community Cabinet papers</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Required as State archives	No change. Previously these records were covered in FA254 and have been moved into FA313. 	To simplify disposal.	2 &amp; 3</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Summary records of unsuccessful and successful community grants.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Required as State archives	Previously summary records were only required as State archives where the information or detail was not otherwise documented in the organisation’s annual report, committee or panel records or ministerial submissions.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This has been changed so that summary records of grants are required as State archives regardless of mentions in annual reports, committee records or panel reports.	Details in annual reports can be minimal and access to information about grants will be facilitated by having the information in one place rather than in committee or panel records. There is public interest in grants awarded by the Premier after a recent ICAC investigation found corrupt conduct by a former Premier in connection with grant funding. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Cabinet Office now requires this type of summary record to be created in the Grants Administration Guide.	4</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Final reports of the outcomes of projects funded by grants. </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Required as State archives.	A gap in coverage was identified.	These reports will record details of the grants process and how public money was spent. 	4</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Successful grant applications.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Retain minimum of 7 years after all grant conditions are complete	Previously successful grant applications for projects or services of State or regional significance were required as State archives.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>This has been removed so that all successful grant applications are retained for 7 years after the project is finalised. 	Grant applications tend to be operational records and the records of successful grants being retained as State archives under entry 4 (deliberations and decisions of committees or panels, submissions to the Premier, Premier’s approval, summary records of grants, and reports of outcomes)  meet State archives’ needs.	5</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Unsuccessful grant applications.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Retain minimum of 7 years after action completed, then destroy	Retention period increased from 4 to 7 years.	To allow for auditing of records which can take place up to 6 years after decision not to approve application.	6</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>State Records NSW consulted with the following:<List><Item>The Audit Office of NSW: the Acting Assistant Auditor-General - Performance Audit  consulted with staff who have worked on audits of grants administration in the past and they have noted that they have not faced any issues previously where they have been unable to access grants administration records because they weren’t retained for a long enough period. </Item><Item>The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC): no response received. </Item><Item>Museums of History NSW supported the changes. </Item></List></Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>Consistent with current decisions applying under FA313, 3.3.3 (2011) but clarifies criteria with respect to records not required as State archives. These types of grant programs generally entail the contribution of financial support to projects undertaken or services delivered by councils or non-profit community groups and organisations. The grants programs will generally entail the distribution of small amounts of money to support a variety of community based projects, services or organisations. The NSW Government's contribution is usually only a proportion of the total cost of the community projects which they fund.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>This has been removed so that all grant applications are retained for 7 years after the project is finalised. Grant applications tend to be operational records and the records of successful grants being retained as State archives under entry 4 (deliberations and decisions of committees or panels, submissions to the Premier, Premier’s approval, summary records of grants, and reports of outcomes) meet State archives needs.</Paragraph>
